          Movies and Music are part of my life. In fact, I could be happy with only music and movies but is a life worth living if we don't interact with other people and explore what the World has to offer us ?
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-8"> <br>
          What does all of this mean? Well, I used to play a bunch of instruments but even if I stopped playing music, I still find it great to have the opportunity of expressing oneself through music and acquire such needed skills. By that, I mean hard-work, motivation, dedication and patience. Music as a listener, is what help me living, working, sleeping as I always listen to music no matter what I do. Movies are just great! Imagination, inspiration and motivation. Let me explain, I like to imagine scenes in an environment and say, this could be part of a great movie. It's a way of viewing the outside world by working on my inside world through imagination, culture and dreams.

          You are probably asking yourself why are you reading all of this. Read the rest, explore the Website and you will understand what this is all about.
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-4"> <br>
          Euh... What does all of this mean again Will? Well, it says profile so it's all about me. By now, you should probably skip this section and visit one of our interests sections. One for every taste, sports, music, movies, fun, food, technologies, working experience and procrastinating. Each week, I add more videos, things you can't miss and you can see everything you should see in a lifetime on my website for free. But if you are too lazy to click on the procrastinating section, you should know that it's a must-see, incredible, life changing, unbelievable, fantastic, torrific, amazing and finally cool section.

          Willou, stop with this deep talking. What does all of this mean once again? Well, if you were more clever, you would have known... (Bim, Bam, Boum, how do you feel about that, you muppet?). All of this talking is simply to tell you how much effort and dedication I have put into creating this Website as it's my first one. If you have any advice, reviews or recommendations that could help me, I would be very happy to hear from you. By the way, if you want to work for me in exchange of a box, yes, you read that right, just a box, in paper, pm me for more info.
